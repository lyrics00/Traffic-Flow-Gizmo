code for checking if two cars have collided: 
    calculate minimumPosition and maximumPosition using certain distance factor (ex. 30 pixels) // since position is denoted from the center of the car, 
                                                                                                // we need to account for the space the car actually takes up
    if car1's x position >= car2's minimumPosition && car1's x position <= car2's maximumPosition:
        stop movements of both cars
        stop all gizmo processes
        show crash image
        put up error message that a crash has occurred, prompt the student to try again and restart the gizmo 

code for calculating average commute time:
    create arbitrary minimum commute time (ex. 10 minutes) for students to strive toward
    for each car:
        count the amount of time the car waits at the red light
    find average time from all cars

    // visual idea: the average commute time can be printed in a certain color denoting how close they are to the minimum (red -> orange -> yellow -> green)

code for turning car left or right:
    deltaTheta = 90 (or -90 depending on direction)
    while (counter < 90) (or counter > -90)
        car.angle += 10 (or another number that creates a smoother-looking turn)
        counter += 10
        car.show 

        (idk if this makes sense)

code for car movement depending on light color:
